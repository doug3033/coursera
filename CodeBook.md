INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXPERIEMENTAL STUDY DESIGN
The dataset used in this study was taken from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net on 4/25/2014.

The study authors described how the study was conducted as follows: The dataset was from a study conducted on 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activity (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3 axial angular velocity at a constand rate of 50hz.  The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.  The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating hte training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometers and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and them sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).  The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.  From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
